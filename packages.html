            <h1>PACKAGES</h1>
        </center>
        <h4>NEED:</h4>
        <p>Packages are used in java in order to prevent naming conflicts , to control access , to make
            searching/locating and usage of classes , interfaces,enumerations and annotations easier</p>
        <p>In short, We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable
            code.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>DEFINITION:</h4>
        <p>The package in java is used to group the related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file
            directory</p>
        <br>
        <h4>NOTE:</h4>
        <p>If you don't use a package statement in your program ,your type ends up in an unnamed
            packages.Generally speaking,an unnamed package is only for small (or) temporary
            applications.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>TYPES:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Built-in Package-the java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use,
                included in the java development environment.</li>
            <li> User defined package-a packages which are created by the programmer(user)
                We can add more classes to a created package by using package name at the top of
                the program and saving it in the package directory. We need a new java file to define a
                public class, otherwise we can add the new class to an existing .java file and recompile
                it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <pre>import java.util.*;</pre>
        <p><strong> util </strong>is a subpackage created inside <strong>java</strong> package</p>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>NOTE:</legend>
            <p>API-Application Programming Interface is
                a document which gives you the list of all the
                packages,classes, and interface ,along with
                their fields and methods.</p>
        </fieldset><br>
        <h4>ADVANTAGES:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be
                easily maintained.</li>
            <li>Java package provides access protection.</li>
            <li>Java package removes naming collision.</li>
            <li>Packages provide reusability of code .</li>
            <li>To bundle classes and interfaces.</li>
            <li>We can create our own Package or extend the already available Package.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>DISADVANTAGES:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>We cannot pass parameters to packages.</li>
            <li> Change in a function needs to be reflected in all the functions that use the changed
                function and hence the whole package needs to be recompiled.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>CONSTRAINS:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Package statement must be the first statement in the program even before the import
                statement.
            </li>
            <li>A package is always defined as a separate folder having the name as the package
                name.
            </li>
            <li>Store all the classes in that package folder</li>
            <li>All classes of the package which we wish to access outside the package must be
                declared public.</li>
            <li>All classes within the package must have the package statement as its first line.</li>
            <li>All classes of the package must be compiled before use.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>IMPORT KEYWORD: </h4>
        <p>import keyword is used to “access” other package members from this package class. Actually, it
            does not import other members into the package,instead it shows the path of the other package
            members to the compiler and JVM.
        </p>
        <h4>PACKAGE KEYWORD:</h4>
        <p>Package is a Java keyword. It declares a 'namespace' for the Java class. It must be
            put at the top of the Java file, it should be the first Java statement line.Ensure that the package
            name will be unique.
        </p>
        <h4>SYNTAX: </h4>
        <p>To create the package:</p><br>
        <pre>              package packagename;
                    public class classname
                    {
                    …...Data members;
                    /
                    public void method() {
                    ……….content ;
                    }
                    }
                    </pre>
        <p>To import:</p><br>
        <pre>                  import package name.class;      // import a single class
                        import package name.*;          // import the whole package
                        class Main
                        {
                        public static void main(String args[])
                        {
                        class obj=new class();         //creating an object for the package class
                        obj.method();                //calling the method in this package present inside the class
                        }
                        }
                        
                        </pre><br>
        <h4>How PACKAGE works?</h4>
        <p>Package names and directory structure are closely related. For example if a package
            name is college.cse.staff, then there are three directories, college, staff and cse such that staff
            is present in cse and cse is present college. Also, the directory college is accessible through the
            CLASSPATH variable, i.e., the path of the parent directory of college is present in CLASSPATH.
            The idea is to make sure that classes are easy to locate.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Package naming conventions: </h4>
        <p>Packages are named in reverse order of domain name:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>DOMAIN NAME </th>
                <th>PACKAGE NAME PREFIX</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>hyphenated_name.example.org</td>
                <td>org.example.hyphenated_name</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>example.int</td>
                <td>int_.example</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>123name.example.com</td>
                <td>com.example._123name</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <h4>NOTE:</h4>
        <p>Sequence of the program must be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Package</li>
            <li>Import</li>
            <li>Class</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h4>BUILT-IN PACKAGES:</h4>
        <p>A well-known built-in package is Scanner which is used to get user input. Here
            Scanner is not a package, it is the class of the particular package called java.util. Some
            examples are,

            <img src="images/built-in-package.png" width="500px 500px">
        </center><br>
        <h4>EXAMPLE:</h4>
        <img src="images/package ex1.png" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>In the example above, java.util is a package, while
            Scanner is a class of the java.util package.To use the
            Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any
            of the available methods found in the Scanner class
            documentation. In our example, we will use the
            nextLine() method, which is used to read a complete
            line.
        </p><br>
        <h4>USER-DEFINED PACKAGE:</h4>
        <p>To create our own package,we need to understand that Java uses a file system
            directory to store them. Just like folders on the computer.</p>
        <h4>EXAMPLE:</h4>
        <h6>1.Single package with one method and import into the main:</h6>
        <img src="images/package ex2.png" width="100%">
        <p>In this Example,one package is created with the name pack.
            In that package a Base class is created.
            Then that package pack is imported to the main class.
            By creating an object to the base class,
            data members and the member function of the base class can be accessed.
        </p><br>
        <h6>2.Package with multiple methods:</h6>
        <img src="images/package ex3.png" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>In this Example,one package is created with the name pack.In that package a Base class is created. Then that
            package pack is imported to the main class.By creating objects
            To the base class,so we accessing data member and member function of the base class .In this program
            additionally,in base class three methods are created
        </p><br>
        <h6>3.Multiple packages:</h6>
        <p><b>Case1:</b> multiple packages with same class
        </p>
        <img src="images/package ex4.png" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>In this Program,Three packages are created Named p1,p2 and p3.Then Importing all Three packages with their
            respective Base class(i.e, BaseA,BaseB and BaseC).In main class,Creating Objects to the Package
            Classes(b1,b2 and b3).By using those object ,Operating Data member and Member Functions of those Base class
            of the Packages.In additionally creating object using packages names(i.e,p1.Base b1) <br>
            <b>Note : </b>
            If the classes in these packages are same,thus using fully qualified name (ie.p1.Base)
        </p><br>
        <p><b>Case2:</b> multiple packages with different classes
        </p>
        <img src="images/package ex5.png" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>In this Program,Three packages are created Named p1,p2 and p3.Then
            Importing all Three packages with their respective Base class(i.e, BaseA,BaseB and BaseC).
            In main class,Creating Objects to the Package Classes(b1,b2 and b3).By using those object ,
            Operating Data member and Member Functions of those Base class of the Packages.
        </p><br>
        <p><b>Case3:</b>packages with different classes using inheritance(same method())
        </p>
        <img src="images/package ex6.png" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>In this Program,Three Packages were Created with the same name pack.
            In main class creating objects to all the Class Base,Derived and C.
            By using Those objects operating the member functions of the Class(i.e, Base,Derived,C). <br>
            <b>Note:</b>Derived class is inherited using extends Keyword.
            It is Derived Class for Base class.So Creating objects to Derived class can Access the Member function of
            the Base class.
        </p><br>
        <p><b>Case4:</b> packages with different classes using inheritance(different method())
        </p>
        <img src="images/package ex7.png" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>In this Example also Three packages with same name pack are created.In 1st pack we created a Base class,in
            2nd pack Derived class is created for the Base class using Extends Keyword and in 3rd pack Class C is
            Created as a Derived class for Derived class.Therefore By Creating Object to Class C can Operate all the
            Member functions of the Base class and Derived class.
        </p><br>
        <p><b>Case5:</b> Packages using constructor (inheritance)
        </p>
        <img src="images/package ex8.png" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>In this example, three packages called pack were created with classes Base,Derived and C , in all those
            package classes were created with a Parameterized constructor. Base class is inherited from package 2 using
            extends keyword(i.e,derived class is derived from base class). Derived class is inherited from package 3
            using extends keyword(i.e, C class is derived from derived class). Therefore Multilevel inheritance. Then
            all packages are imported to the main class. Then object c is created to class C. While creating an object
            to constructor it automatically calls the class. In all these classes a super keyword is used(it points to
            the immediate Base/super class). So while creating objects for class C we can access the Base class.

        <h6>Q1. How will you call m1 of class A of sub-package scien and m2 of class A of sub-package tech from class B
            of sub-package scien?
            Let’s create a program using the first approach to call the following requirement.
        </h6>
        <img src="images/pack example images2.png" width="100%">
        <h6>Will the above code compile? </h6>
        <ul>
            <li>No: because the statement A a = new A(); does not say anything about class A from which sub-packages
                (scien or tech) it is referring.</li>
            <li>No: because the statement A a1 = new A(); is also not saying anything about class A of which
                sub-packages (scien or tech) it is referring.</li>
            <li>No: because a.m1() and a1.m2() will get confused to call the method of which package’s class. Here, the
                compiler will be also confused.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this case, the import is not working. So, we remove the import statement and use the fully qualified name.
        </p>

        <h6>OUTPUT:</h6>
        <p>Hi </p>
        <p>Hello </p>
        <p>Hello Java</p>
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>Suppose you are not using public with m2() method in the above program then it will give error ” The method
            m2() from the type A is not visible” because it is a default and default access modifier cannot be accessed
            from outside the package.</p>

        <h6>Q2.Write a program creating three classes to get employee details, calculate employee salary, get company
            details. Create these classes with different packages. In this, inherent employee details and calculating
            employee salary class. Get the employee details like name, salary, working hours in a separate method. Get
            the company details in a separate method. While calculating salary i) addSalary() --> increments salary to
            500 if the salary is above 5000
            ii) addWork() --> increments salary to 250 if hours is above 6.

        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>In this program, Three packages named, Emp, Calc,Comp.in those packages required variables
            and Constructors are created. Here Super keyword(which call the immediate Base class) is used in
            All the classes. (Empdetails is Base class for EmpCalculation, EmpCalculation is Base class for Compdetails)
            Then all packages are imported to main class. Then by creating a object to derived class Compdetials
            Access the data member and member function of the package classes
