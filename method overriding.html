                <h1>METHOD OVERRIDING</h1>
            </b>
        </center>
        <h4>NEED:</h4>
        <p>In inheritance, the parent class and child class may sometimes have same name for data
            member and member function. The member function has same number of arguments, same
            data type.In this scenario, the derived class object may not able to access the content of base
            class. In order to overcome these drawbacks, a super keyword is used.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>DEFINITION:</h4>
        <p>If Derived class has the same method or same data members as in base class,it is known
            as method overriding.This is nearly the same as method overloading,main difference is that
            overriding occurs at the runtime,overloading occurs at compile time</p>
        <br>
        <h4>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN METHOD OVERLOADING AND OVERRIDING:</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>METHOD OVERLOADING</th>
                <th>METHOD OVERRIDING</th>

                    derived class.

        <h4>OCCURRENCE:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Occurs at data members-</b> Overriding occurs when the data members in Derived class
                is the same as in base class.
            </li>
            <li><b>Occurs at member function-</b>Overriding occurs when the member function in Derived
                class is the same as in base class.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>SYNTAX:</h4>
        <pre>     class Base
            {
                int data;               //Overridden method
                void display()
                {
                ……..
                }
            }
            class Derived extends Base
            {
                //Overriding method
                int data;          // same data member
                void display()       // same member function
                {
                …...
                }
            }
        </pre>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b>: In this derived class has the same data member and same member function as in base
            class. So,it is called method overriding.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>EXAMPLE:</h4>
        <h6>1.Method overriding at datamember:</h6>
        <img src="images/method overriding ex1.jpeg" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>A base and derived class with the same data member a with data type called double are created.
            In main class ,create an object for derived class and call the display() method,the pointer goes to derived
            class and search for display() method in that current class.In that, print the a and a1 values, it prints
            Derived class float a value and base class int a1 value as the output.
            Because, a is present in both the classes and a1 is in parent class. The priority is to print the current
            invoked class data. <br> <b>Note:</b> Here, Derived class takes the same data member double a as the base
            class.
            Note that,in base class there are two data member a( one of integer data type and another with the double
            data type). Overriding takes at the same data member with the same datatype.
        </p><br>
        <h6>2.Method overriding at member function:</h6>
        <img src="images/method overriding ex2.jpeg" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>A base and derived class with the same member function display() with same return type are created. In the
            main class , When an object for the derived class is created and calls the display() method,it goes to the
            derived class method and prints the Child class,since the object points to the derived class.
            <br><b>Note:</b>
            Here member function in both Derived and base is the same . </p>
        <br>
        <p>In these two cases ,by using Derived class object we cannot be able to call the base class method.</p>
        <p>To overcome this, there are two methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using super keyword.</li>
            <li>Using dynamic method dispatch. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>SUPER KEYWORD:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Super is the keyword, it is used for calling the parent class method or constructor.</li>
            <li>In this, we can use super keyword in two places:
                <ul style="list-style-type:square ;">
                    <li>Calling the data member and method- super. Used to call the data members and method of base
                        class.</li>
                    <li>Calling constructor-super() Used to call the constructor of base class </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If in multiple and multilevel inheritance super keyword invokes the immediate current base class.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4> CONSTRAINS:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Super can be used to refer to immediate parent class instance variables.</li>
            <li>Super can be used to invoke immediate parent class methods.</li>
            <li>Super with parameter parenthesis is used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>2.ACCESS BASECLASS ATTRIBUTE:</h4>
        <img src="images/method overriding ex4.jpeg" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>A parent and child class with the same data members a and string as its datatype is created . In main, create
            an object for the derived class and make a call to the printMessage() method. It invokes the derived class
            method. In that, print the value of the datamember a of derived class and also the parent class datamember a
            by using the super. keyword.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>3.USE OF SUPER TO ACCESS BASE CLASS CONSTRUCTOR:</h4>

        <img src="images/MO EXPLANATION3.jpeg" width="30%"><br>
        <br>
        <h4>DYNAMIC METHOD DISPATCH:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Runtime polymorphism.</li>
            <li>The process of calling the base class method is resolved at runtime is known as dynamic method dispatch.
            </li>
            <li>In other words,when the base class reference variable points to the derived class during method call the
                derived class method is executed,this call is determined by the type of object at runtime.</li>
            <li>This method also is for calling the data members and member functions of both parent and child classes
                using reference variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>EXAMPLE:</h4>
        <img src="images/method overriding ex7.jpeg" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p>here base and derived class are created.in main, an object for both base class and for derived class are
            created, calling its method and accessing the base datamember using the base object within the main.In this
            dynamic method dispatch takes place at,when the reference object for base class is created and make it to
            points to the derived class,and make a call for the derived class method and accessing its data members.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>REAL-TIME PROGRAMS:</h4>
        <h6>How to use method overriding in Inheritance for subclasses ?Write a java program to find the area of the
            rectangle using method overriding. Also, identify the two approaches for accessing the base class contents.
        </h6>
        <h6>Solution:</h6>
        <p>This example demonstrates the way of method overriding by subclasses with different number and type of
            parameters.</p>
        <img src="images/method overriding ex8.jpeg" width="100%">
        <h6>EXPLANATION:</h6>
        <p><b> Parent class: </b>A parameter constructor and area() with double as its return type created in parent
            class name
            Figure. <br>
            <b> Child class:</b>A parameter constructor and area() same as parent class with double as its return type
            is
            created in child class named Rectangle. <br>
            Note that, in this example we used both super and dynamic method dispatch methods to implement method
            overriding. <br>
            In main,we created the object for the both parent and child classes,and passed an arguments.while creating
            an object for child class,since it is a constructor,passed arguments should
            be assigned to the base class while creating the object itself. Call to the parameterized constructor using
            super() keyword. <br>
            Thus we assign the values to the data members of the base class using super keyword.
            Then in main we have created a parent class reference variable . Then we made it to point to the base class
            and derived class,thus base class and derived class method can be accessed through it respectively.That
            is,parent class object f is assigned to reference object figref,and we make a call figref.area(), it returns
            the value from the parent class.While,child class object r is assigned to reference object figref,and we
            make a call figref.area(), it returns the value from the child class.</p>
